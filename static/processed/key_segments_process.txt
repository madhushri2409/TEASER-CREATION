 We've learnt something new for the day. There you go. A GC. That was my chair. She wins. We've got WD40. WD40, please. How dare you suggest any videos? Not just everyone at the herd. But if you couldn't suggest it. Oh. Open the firing line. Oh! You're not on camera yet. Oh, it's a torture garden. You say better out than anything. Sorry. Matthew? We have way too much fun on your show. I'm sorry. OK. Well, Christmas. I've known for the chair. A Christmas mystery has presented itself to a family in Ohio. It all started with letters from Santa and two Santa. Someone enters. Someone enters. And then, and could not. I hate you. Well, more bodily functions in the news this morning. The next time you pass gas, make sure no police are around. A man in West Virginia faces assault charges after police say he passed gas and the office. We don't laugh. I don't. The after the man was already arrested for DUI. According to police reports, that could even get burnt. He passed a gas zone while in the office. It was quote, very odorous and created a concept of insulting or provoking nature. Mr. Anchor. See, that wasn't even right. That was the put that story in there was wrong. That was wrong, right? I can see what I was looking through the script. He stuck that in there. Very odorous. There you go. All right. The scary moments for customers at a Kansas Home Depot, police responded to reports of a bomb threat at the store in Wichita, a customer alerted employees. A man inside the bathroom said there was a bomb in the building. Police were able to locate the man responsible for those comments. And that man told police he warned other guests to leave the restroom because he was, quote, fix into blow it up, but had no intention of causing a panic. Man also told police. Others in the room laughed, understanding his joke, which I'm just not getting. Deepo says they will not be pressing charges. But I can tell you right now, you asked the producer for me to read that thing there. To even now, please. No. I think I have to go to a commercial. No, we're going to get it. We're going to get it. Well, in Wichita, Kansas, police were alerted to a bomb threat that may have been a little more than an understanding. A Home Depot employee called 911 to say they heard someone in the bathroom outlining a plan to blow up the home improvement store. Now, police were able to track down the man responsible for the alleged threat because it turns out upon entering in the restroom, the man said, quote, y'all need to get out of here because I'm fixing to blow it up, which of course is a euphemism for describing his foul movement. Now, similar incident happened in New Orleans last year. A man using a similar euphemism was arrested, allegedly threatened to blow up. Willis, chicken jack. Y'all can't tell me that. His wife's friends is the reason why this job is worth it. It is these moments right here. You can't tell me that. Your papa or your daddy never said that going into that. That's my old family. It's got to be on watch. In November, he admitted following then 21-year-old Tanya Billingsley home. He's set it had an emergency defecation situation and needed to use her bathroom, but the judge in the case found he had a sexual motive. The emergency defecation situation. LAUGHTER Anyway, carry on, Hillary. Yeah, I think I'm having one myself. LAUGHTER Because this next story is so tragic, I cannot be laughing. Right. Investigators believe a bomb caused the explosion on a plane which has just taken off from the Somali capital of Mogadishu, the blast blew a hole on the side of the plane, and one of the 74 passengers on board was signed out. And I'm just terrible. And I'm not laughing at that. As the plane was a relatively low altitude, there was no violent decompression and it held together. No one is... Responsibility. Today could be the day I lose my job. LAUGHTER Due to the clown was driving through downtown Toronto with a few other clowns when he noticed a man acting strangely. Due to the clowns saw the man running toward two women, so he yelled out a warning. The women jumped in the clown car. And in seconds later, the man attacked the car, ripped off the side mirrors. Those women were safe and it's all thanks to Dudu. When I got home, first thing when I got home, and I don't want to get emotional, especially, first thing my daughter, 12 years old, came up and said, Dad, you're my hero. Say, I can't say I get emotional. Oh, man. Dudu, the clown says that he's glad that he was there to help. He knows it could have been a really bad situation. The suspect in this case, now facing several charges, as he should have at least believed. That suspect was on drugs at the time. Thank goodness for that clown. OK, when two clowns crashed, it was no laughing matter. And no, it was not part of their act. The two elderly men crashed their minivan on their way to the local fair. The driver, 83-year-old James Billingsley, AKA Dimples, the clown, Collin. He missed the entrance. But when he tried to make a U-turn, he slammed right into an SUV. They're OK. Police say Dimples was wearing oversized clown shoes. But boy, he said that they did not play a role in the crash. Oh, no. I didn't even know laughing. Oh, for the moment. I'm so sorry. I can't believe you made this a bit of story. And nobody was helping me. No, no. We were actually working for where I'm at. Oh, man. Sorry, Roxanne. You got through. It should be part of their act now. I'm much, much, much, right. I need some big clown shoes tomorrow. No. No. No. No. I don't know what you're laughing at. Well, I'm not laughing at the story. Yeah. Because the story is serious. But, man, I apologize. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. One pot. One pot belly pig. I certainly enjoyed his share of problems. Chris P. Bacon was born without the use of his cycle. I come back. I come back. My gang. You have to read this story. We should not. Oh my god. He's taking customer service to a whole new level. Yeah, he wants to make sure that when his customers want fresh meat, they get it. You could have gotten through that. I've got everything he's not here. Every time he's here. Even when his door is closed. He would do it well. That is why he installed a living machine for meat. It's the first of its kind in the country. The other helps his customer use the new device to get their broths and their bacon, Chris. I love bacon. Greek broth with feta and olives, a broth with wild rice, tomato, basil, parmesan, and broth. You know, I've been waiting for years for this. So I'm pretty pumped. I think that's pretty cool. I think that's probably going to get some use. No, Chris. The price of meat sold on the many machines is the same as inside the store. No, no, no, no. Something special at the National Western Stock Show today is bison hump day.
